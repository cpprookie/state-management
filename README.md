webapp state management in redux mobx &amp; rxjs

use react as view render in multiple events scene to find out **reasons** that we need state-management tools and difference between them.

1. Run scripts in bash
- `git clone https://github.com/cpprookie/state-management` to clone this repo.
- `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- `npm start` to start demo.
2. open `localhost:9000` in browser.

3. checkout branches for comparing  between state-management and deep props. 

- `git checkout redux-sample` for redux usage.
- `git checkout mobx-sample` for mobx usage.

After switching to new branch, you need to run `npm install` for new dependencies.
